This repository contains basic files to get you started with a HTML and Javascript website. No library, nothing fancy.

## What's in this project?
← README.md: That's this file, where you can tell people what your cool website does and how you built it.

← index.html: This is the main HTML page for your site.

← style.css: CSS files add styling rules to your content.

← script.js: If you're feeling fancy you can add interactivity to your site with JavaScript.

← favicon.ico: This is the icon of your website, that appears in the tab.
